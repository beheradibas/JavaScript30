    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const playersCopy = [...players];
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log( players )
    console.log( playersCopy )
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    playersCopy.push('Edward');
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log( players )
    console.log( playersCopy )
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const players2 = players.slice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players3 =  [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const players4 = Array.from(players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social : {
        facebook : "dev",
        twitter : 'lop'
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = {...person};
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const person4 =  JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
